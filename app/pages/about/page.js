        AKATSUKI
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 m-10 text-center">
        Akatsuki ÊöÅ is a criminal organization made up of S-Class fugitive ninja
        and highly wanted by the ninja world. Their main objective is to collect
        all biju or "Tailed Creatures" for the purpose of dominating the world.
        Although initially Akatsuki only played a small role in Part I , but in
        Part II they have become the main antagonists of the series. Akatsuki
        members (at any given time) will not exceed ten members and they are
        listed as S-class fugitive ninja by their village. Its members always
        move in groups of two except Zetsu who acts as a spy or scout for the
        organization by using his unique abilities to the organization's
        advantage. each team must function well, or at least have to complete
        the given mission even if the members of each team have disputes between
        them. All the members of this organization rarely get together as seen
        at the end of Part I when one member states that it is their first
        meeting after the last meeting seven years ago. Akatsuki's network is
        very wide, covering several ninja countries with the help of their
        secret agents in many places. When a team manages to get the tailed
        creature as instructed, they need to immediately lock it up. All this is
        done in their secret fortress surrounded by various traps. This
        confinement process takes three days to complete.
